https://github.com/SpongeFX/simshot/assets/152398516/8f4dfd2c-98bf-4934-b3d4-8d5e296b0c8d



Simshot moves points along specified trajectories, determining collisions with polygonal geometric objects, where it creates points at the intersections of polygons and a polygonal model of the trajectory of movement inside the polygonal object. Asset calculates the rebound effect with a configurable bounce angle threshold. The points and polygons created as a result of calculations have special attributes for applying accompanying effects.


## üíæ  Installation 
[Download the HDA file](otls/simshot.1.0.hdalc) and install it to your `houdini19.5/otls/` folder. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Houdini documentation](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/assets/install.html)

## ‚òëÔ∏è Features
+ Tested in Houdini versions: 19.5
+ SOP/DOP packed and unpacked geometry support.
+ Interactions with simulation and/or animation in real time.
+ Rebound Effect: Customizable bounce when hitting polygons at sharp angles.
+ Explosion mode for placement at the locations of the sources of explosion in collisions.
+ Flexible velocity settings for use in simulations.
+ Defines polygons that occur inside other polygon objects in RBD simulations with basic collision parameter values, which can significantly reduce simulation time in scenes where other effects do not require high collisions.
+ The emitter of points can move during simulation.

#### Requirements for incoming geometry:
- Incoming geometry must have a string point attribute with a unique value for each object.
- If you are using fragmented geometry, there should be a group attribute specifying whether each primitive is inside or outside.
- Optional: Vector point attribute named "<i>velocity(v)</i>" is necessary if <a href="#enable_opo"><i>Output Point Offset</i></a> is enabled.
- For unpacked geometry to work correctly, each primitive in the incoming geometry must have a primitive attribute called "<i>xform</i>" containing a matrix of transformations.

<b>4</b>. Go to the <b>Setup</b> tab, and set name of the attribute with a unique value <img src="https://github.com/SpongeFX/simshot/assets/152398516/e4af500d-5b88-4cec-83c0-755b12f8f35b" width="170" height="23" align="center" alt="pieceattrib" > for each object, if it is different from the default name. If you are using fragmented geometry with closely spaced primitives, enable <a href="#fragmented">Fragmented Geometry</a>. Read the description of the <a href="#parm">parameters</a> and configure it as you want.

<b>5</b>. Add emitter and target points. 
To conveniently add points for calculating the trajectory of movement, it is recommended to use [HDA aim](https://github.com/SpongeFX/aim/).
1. If you are using HDA aim and have disabled "<i>direction correction</i>", and then go <a href="#next_0">next step</a>.
2. If "<i>direction correction</i>" is enabled, go to the ‚Äù<i>Targets</i>‚Äù tab and enable the "<i>Start Position Attribute</i>" toggle (recommend linking these parameters), and then go <a href="#next_0">next step</a>.

Alternative method without using HDA aim:  If you are not using HDA aim, you can set the start and target points with the necessary attributes in the ‚Äú<i>Emitters</i>‚Äù and ‚Äú<i>Targets</i>‚Äù tabs. However, please note that this method has limited functionality.

<b>Emitters</b> tab:
1. Enable the "<i>Enable Adding Points</i>" option.
2. Add a points and set the starting point positions.
   
<b>Targets</b> tab:
1. Turn on the "<i>Enable Adding Points</i>" option.
2. Change the next parameters if you want:<br>
<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="20%"><i>Start Frame</i></td>
        <td><p>Default start frame.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><i>Frames Between Active</i></td>

    </tr>
</table>  

3. Add a points and set the target point positions.
   
<a id="next_0"></a><b>6</b>. Set the settings in the <b>Explode</b> tab:
1. Add a moving point to a special group temporarily during the collision.
2. Optionally, remove this point from the simulation later.
3. This can be useful as a reference position for the source of the explosion.
4. Review the settings in the <a href="#explode"><i>Explode</i></a> tab if you are interested in this functionality.

<b>7</b>. Set the settings for bounces from primitives when intersecting:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">In the <a href="#ric">Ricocheted</a> tab, you have the option to disable or enable the bounce effect when colliding with sharp angles on primitives. You can also adjust the bounce angle threshold and other parameters.</td>
        <td width = "252"><p><img src="https://github.com/SpongeFX/simshot/assets/152398516/d7417ee7-d1c2-4656-b288-ff28a3101e3b" width="248" height="101"></p></td>
    </tr>
</table><br>

<b>8</b>. Once you have created and positioned the emitters and target points, activate the timeline to run the asset simulation. If you are using HDA aim, you can create target points during the simulation while the timeline is active.

<b>9</b>. Cache the result you like and apply the effects you need using the points, primitives and their attributes produced by the asset. To view the points and primitives generated by an asset, add a Merge node, set its display flag, and connect it to the asset's *output1* and *output2*.<br>

If you import geometry from a DOP simulation, you can send the *velocity*(v) back to the source of the imported simulation for reverse interaction. This feature is not recursive, but it allows you to interact with the simulation in real time if your computer is powerful enough.

## üìÇ Tabs and Parameters

### üìÅ Source
The incoming target points must have the following point attributes: <i>i@emit</i>, which represents the emitter point number, and <i>f@speed</i>, indicating the speed of the point along its trajectory. If the "<i>Start Position Attribute</i>" is enabled in the <i>Targets</i> tab, an additional point attribute <i>v@startpos</i> needs to be added. The point movement will begin once the value of the attribute <i>f@speed</i> exceeds 0.

To select the source and type of incoming geometry go to the "<i>Geometry Source</i>", and set the path to the geometry.

        <td valign="top" width="18%"><i>Transfer Attributes</i></td>
        <td><p>If you choose DOP as the geometry source, you can use the "<i>Transfer Attributes</i>" parameter to transfer specified attributes to the unpacked geometry, which will be available in <i>output4</i>.</p></td>

## üìÅ Trails 	 
In this tab, you can configure primitive curves that follow the trajectory of movement inside the object. The points for the subsequent connection of their polygons are created in the POP DOP Network inside the asset and the settings in the *Source*, *Birth*, *Attributes* tabs are the POP Source settings inside popnet. The emitter for creating points are the entry and exit points, as well as a moving point while it is inside the object. Each curve related to a specific object has an attribute with a unique value that allows it to be identified separately or as a group by the id of the point that created the line. The attribute value is of type "0_1", where "0" is the id of the point that determined the intersection, and "1" is the id of a specific line belonging to one object.

## üìÅ Velocity
In this tab, you can create and configure a vector point attribute of *velocity*(v) for use in various scenarios. For example, you can transfer velocity to the rbd simulation in order to influence it during the simulation. It works like this: at the moment of collision or constantly (depending on the state of the [*On-Hit*](#onhit) toggle), a line is created from points with the *velocity*(v) attribute, and then this data is imported into the simulation. The *velocity*(v) here is the normalized vector of the direction "*v@dir*" of motion multiplied by the speed attribute "*f@speed*". To see the template, turn on the ‚Äú*Velocity Template Visualization*‚Äù toggle, create and connect Null to *output3*, and turn on the null display flag. Enable displaying point trails in the viewport to visualize the *velocity*(v). Customize the template according to your preferences and turn off the ‚Äú*Velocity Template Visualization*‚Äù toggle.

## üîé Example
The example file contains simshot and aim assets, as well as a few simple examples of interacting with simulations and applying effects. This example file does not include some parts of the scene that you can see in this article, such as the spark effect, DOP FLIP, and the chain of simultaneous interaction between RBD DOP/SOP, FLIP DOP, and the asset when the FLIP simulation takes into account collisions with packed geometry and affects to this geometry during the simulation. This has some configuration features, but the general principle is the same as in the example presented. It is also procedural and works in real-time, but slower because, as a rule, the FLIP simulation uses high-resolution VDB to calculate collisions with fragmented packed geometry.

Download the example file [*simshot_example.hiplc*](/example/simshot_example.hiplc) and the folder "*geo*" with the bullet geometry file inside. Download and install [HDA simshot](https://github.com/SpongeFX/simshot/otls/simshot.hdalc) and [HDA aim](https://github.com/SpongeFX/aim/otls/aim.1.0.hdalc). Open the example file, go to the Geometry object "*SIM_shooting*", select the HDA aim in the Network View, select the camera "*aim*" in the viewport, activate the timeline, and click the left mouse button (LMB) in the viewport window. You will see how the point on which the bullet geometry is copied will start moving along the trajectory from the camera position "*aim*" towards the position where the LMB click was made. When the trajectory intersects with the geometry, the force will affect the fragmented pieces.

### üìÅ /obj/Boolean/
Go to the "*Boolean*" geometric object. Here you can add holes in the places where the intersections of the geometry were found, or disable it. The selection takes place in the *switch1* node. In the example file, the switch1 switch is already connected to the corresponding parameter of the geometry source in HDA simshot. If you select SOP and use unpacked geometry, then the corresponding input is selected in *switch1*, where unpacking geometry is excluded.
Changes to the geometry are made by the SOP node *Boolean*, to increase the calculation speed, only those objects with which the intersection was determined are selected.

If this is a packed geometry simulation, you can use the *velocity*(v) attribute in the simulation and leave holes at the same time. At the same time, if the values of the *velocity*(v) attribute are high and in the next frame the geometric object with which the intersection was recorded overtakes the moving point, then a short line of 0.001 length is created on the object, having a starting point at the position found in the last frame, added to the enter group, and an end point in the position - *@N* + 0.001, not added to the exit group. 

Geometry construction for *Boolean* is performed in SOP node polywire based on data from *output2* of HDA simshot, noise is added to *pointvop1*. 

You can also extend the proxy geometry of the lines so that they overlap the object for *Boolean* to work correctly.

Changing the length in the ‚Äú*Value*‚Äù parameter in the Primitive Wrangle "*increase_the_length*". You can disable hole creation by toggle *switch2*. 

You can also disable unpacking for geometry not participating in the for-each loop.

### üìÅ /obj/SIM_explode/
The geometric object "*SIM_explode*" contains the emitter settings for the explosion. When Explosion mode is enabled in HDA Simshot, imported cars will be added to a special group in case of collision. Point positions are used for pyroburstsource. The points added to the group are assigned the attribute *f@cur_frame* to calculate the initial frame of the pyroburstsource and pyrosolver simulation. For correct calculation, it is recommended to connect the ‚Äú[*Explode Delay*](#edelay)‚Äù parameter in "*start_frame_attrib*" with the parameter of the same name in HDA simshot, as shown in the example.
The Object Merge node "*OUT_V_EXPLODE*" import the velocity for interacting with the simulation. The interaction takes place through a velocity transfer inside the DOP Network "*dopnet_rbd*" using the Geometry VOP DOP "*velocity_explode*", which has 2 parameters: "*Force multiplier*" ‚Äì a force multiplier that increases the impact, and "*Minimum Distance*" ‚Äì the minimum distance from the points generated by pyroburstsource to the points of the simulation object to which the *velocity*(v) will be transferred.<br>
If you want to visualise smoke, activate the display flag on the "*RNDR_explode*" node.<br>

Here, you can adjust the emission of smoke at collision sites or apply emitter settings for other effects. In the Network Box "*Emitters settings*", there are settings for the shape, the number of emitter points, and the vector attribute *velocity*(v). Select "*Display point trails*" in the viewport to see the *velocity*(v) vector. Set the display flag on the Attribute Wrangle node "*height_ctrl_ENTRY*" to see the geometry on which the emitter points will be applied. Set the height of the sphere slice (parameter "*Height*") and the angle of inclination of the *velocity*(v) vector (parameter "*Normal Angle*"), if needed. In the *scatter* node, set the desired number of emitter points and add noise in the Attribute VOP "*noise_vel*", if needed.

The Attribute Wrangle "*group_filter*" controls the duration of the emitters. The duration of emitter activity is set in the ‚Äú*Group Removal Delay*‚Äù parameter, which in this example is associated with the ‚Äú*Group Removal Delay*‚Äù parameter in HDA simshot, performing an identical function.

In Attribute Wrangle "*filter_for_nearby_sources*", points located in close positions are removed. This parameter is relevant for fragmented geometry when there is a collision with a fragmented object, whose pieces are tightly adjacent to each other. In this case, the emitter will only be created on the first and last intersected primitive. The emitter will also be created on intersected primitives if the distance between the intersected primitives is greater than the ‚Äú*Threshold*‚Äù parameter. For example, when a fragmented object is being destroyed. This is necessary to avoid unnecessary calculations and emitters for effects inside the fragmented geometry in case it is not destroyed. Disable this in *switch1* if it is not required.

If you need smoke collisions, go to ‚Äú*dopnet1*‚Äù, turn off bypass Volume Source Dop object ‚Äú*collision_vol_src*", connect it via the *Merge* node and configure voxel size vdb in ‚Äú*/obj/SRC_DOP_collision_geo/collisionsource*". This will increase the simulation time. You can also use *billowsmoke* from the toolshelf, sometimes it works faster.

If you want to enable smoke emission in intersections and visualise smoke, activate the display flag on the "*RNDR_smoke*" node.

#### üìî NetBox ‚ÄúDOP SIM‚Äù
This NetBox contains the DOP Network "*dopnet_rbd*", the simulation result of which is imported into HDA simshot to determine intersections. Go into "*dopnet_rbd*", inside you can see a standard set of nodes for working with packed geometry, such as rigidbody solver, gravity, constraint network, and others. There are also nodes with custom settings for interacting with the simulation. Points with the *velocity*(v) attribute are imported from HDA simshot to the Geometry VOP Dop "*velocity*", where the minimum distance from the imported points to the packed simulation object (the position of the center point) is determined. If the distance is valid, *velocity*(v) is transformed into *v@force* attribute, which is applied to the packed simulation object in the rigidbody solver. Settings allow you to flexibly adjust the effect of force on objects.

## üí¨ Feedback

This version does not reduce the speed after collisions and bounces, and also does not allow you to determine the density and type of materials under various processing scenarios, and much more. I have a lot of ideas on how to develop the asset and this direction, but maybe someone will have interesting suggestions or suggestions, it would be very interesting to know about it, and If you have any feedback or run into issues, please feel free to open an issue on this GitHub project.
